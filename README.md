# Download

Downlaod [the latest version of Memespector-GUI for Windows, Mac OS or Linux](https://github.com/jason-chao/memespector-gui/releases/).

When you open Memespector-GUI for the first time on Windows or Mac, the operating system may decline to run Memespector-GUI because of tightened security measures.  If this happens, please follow [the instructions on how to allow Memespector-GUI to run at first launch on Windows and Mac](doc/FirstRun.md).

# Gaining access to APIs

You have to get authentication keys from Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Clarifai in order to use their APIs.

1. If you wish to use **Google Vision API**, you must obtain a credential key file from Google Cloud.  See [the instructions on how to activate Google Cloud Service and obtain an authentication file](doc/GetKeyFromGoogleCloud.md).
2. If you wish to use **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision**, you must obtain a service endpoint and subscription key from Microsoft Azure.  See [the instructions on how to activate Microsoft Azure and obtain authentication keys](doc/GetKeyFromMicrosoftAzure.md).
3. If you wish to use **Clarifai**, you must obtain an API key from Clarifai. See [the instructions on how to obtain an API key from Clarifai](doc/GetKeyFromClarifai.md).  

# Usage

*Note:  The graphical user interfaces of Memespsector-GUI are nearly identical across the Windows, Mac and Linux versions.  For illustrative purpose, the screenshots of the Windows version are used in this document.  The following steps also apply to the Mac and Linux versions of Memespector-GUI.*

### Open source models
 
*Caution: The API that serves open source pre-trained computer vision models is experimental.  It does not offer the same level of performance as the commercial APIs.  The default endpoint in Memespector-GUI is for evaluation purpose only.*

Check the box for `Open Source`.  

![screenshot](doc/res/gui-os-endpoint.jpg)

#### Select the convolutional neural network (only if necessary)

The open source models are made available by machine learning library [Keras](https://keras.io/).  These models were trained on the [ImageNet database](https://www.image-net.org/).  Just leave the default option unchanged unless you want to study these models.  The differences between them are in the construction of convolutional neural networks.  If interested in the details, see [here](https://keras.io/api/applications/).

## Add images to Memespector-GUI

### Images on a computer

Click `image files on this computer`.  Select the image files.  Click `Open`.  The locations of the image files will be added to the `Image Sources` box.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-individual-files.jpg)

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-individual-file-locations.jpg)

If you want to add all images inside a folder with many sub-folders which also contain images, click `a folder containing images on this computer`.  Select the folder.   The location of the folder will be added to the `Image Sources` box.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-a-folder.jpg)

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-a-folder-locations.jpg)

*(Change of display behaviour from Version 0.2.3 beta:  Only the location of the selected (outermost) folder will be displayed in the `Image Sources` box.  The locations of image files inside the folder (and its subfolders) do not have to be displayed in the box in order to be processed.  This change does not affect the total number of image files to be processed.)*

### Images on the web

If you are going to process hundreds or thousands of URLs, paste the URLs into a text (.txt) file.  Put one URL per line.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-web-urls-txt.jpg)

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-txt-file.jpg)

Click `a text file containing image locations`.  Select the text file.  Click `Open`.  The location of the text file containing the URLs will be added to the `Image Sources` box.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-a-txt-file-location.jpg)

If you are going to just a few or tens of URLs, copy and paste the URLs of the images into the `Image Sources` box.  Put one URL per line.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-web-locations.jpg)

## Edit the names for output files

Memespector-GUI generates two output files.  The JSON file stores the structured data values in full generated by the computer vision APIs.  The CSV file contains a version of the data transformed into a tabular format which may be easily opened using general software tools like spreadsheet editors.

Click `Browser` to the right of each field to change the name and location of an output file.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-outputfiles.jpg)

## Invoke the APIs

Click `Invoke APIs` after you have changed the APIs' settings, added image files or URLs to the `Image locations` box and/or edited the output filenames.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-invokebutton.jpg)

Memespector-GUI will show the progress of sending the images to the APIs.

![Screenshot](doc/res/gui-win-progress.jpg)

Once all images are processed, a message about the completion will be shown.  Open the output files to see the results.
